  <h1>How to plant trees</h1>
  <h3>
    The reason I started sustainable superheroes was that in the winter I was literally skiing with t-shirts on, and it only snowed at the ski place.
  </h3>
   <h3>And I live in south-central PA, not anywhere near the equator.</h3>
   <h2>Seed or sapling?</h2>
   <p>I reccomend sapling because the tree has already started to grow, but If you are up to a challenge, you can use a seed.
   This article assumes you are using a sapling.</p>
   <h2>where to plant your tree</h2>

   <p><strong>Remember to check local laws about trees, and in the US, call 811 before you dig!!!</strong></p>
