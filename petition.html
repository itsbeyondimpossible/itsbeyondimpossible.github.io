    <h2>No more subsidies to non-renewable energy companies!</h2>
    <p>What does this mean?<br>

Doing this means not paying non-renewable energy companies money, and possibly paying renewable energy companies money to support more ecologically friendly energy.<br>

Why is stopping subsidies to non-renewable energy a good idea?<br>
<ul>
<li>This would help the change to renewable energy</li>
<li>It would allow the government to spend money differently, because the government is not paying non-renewable energy companies</li>
</ul>
Who does this affect?<br>

This affects every living creature on earth, by making air quality better and people healthier, reducing climate change, and greatly reducing usage of natural resources.<br>

How does this help the environment?<br>

<ul>
<li>Non-renewable energy releases things known as greenhouse gasses, which stops heat from escaping, and heating up earth.</li>

<li>Non-renewable energy also uses up resources, and will run out eventually. Scientists estimate that in 50 years we will run out of coal.</li>

<li>Non-renewable energy also releases harmful gasses that cause a variety of problems, from cancer to pneumonia.</li>

How much subsidies do non-renewable energy companies get?<br>

The coal and petroleum industries get about $20 billion dollars a year!<br>
