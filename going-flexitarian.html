If you want to be vegitarian/vegan but cannot do so or you love meat but don't want to be cruel to animals/unsustainable, you might want to become flexitarian.<br>
Being flexitarian means you try not to eat meat as much as possible, but make exceptions sometimes, like on holidays or when you are at someone elses house and you don't want to throw meat away<strong> which is even worse because you waste the meat</strong>,<br>
To become flexitarian, here are some good things to keep in mind:
<ol>
<li>try to eat out less</li>
<li>only order 1 meat item from the grocery store for each week and one item when you eat out each week.</li>
<li>create a chart with the number of meat items you eat every week and try to have it be less than an average of 2 items each week.</li>
<ol>
