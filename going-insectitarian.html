<p>If you want to become vegan/vegitarian but cannot afford to do so, (if you are in this situation you could try <a href="going-flexitarian.html">becoming flexitarian</a>)<br>
you might want to try becoming insectitarian.
Insects are very sustainable sources of meat (and healthy ones too),and in some cultures they are even considered a delicacy!<br>
People often think insects are gross, but that can be false, and there are lots of different bugs and recipes you can try!<br>
(for the animal lovers on this website, insects have low consciousness)</p>
