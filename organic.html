<h1>Organic</h1>
<h2>What is organic?</h2>
<p>Organic is a method of farming, and goes somewhere along these lines (It is different in different countries):
    <ul>
        <li>No GMO</li>
        <li>No synthetic pesticides/herbicides/fungicides/etc.</li>
        <li>No sythetic fertilizers</li>
    </ul>
    Organic farmers are supposed to use more traditional methods, like crop rotation.
    Organic food has become very popular over the last decade.
</p>
<h2>Is it good?</h2>
<h3>Health</h2><p>If you read what I said earlier, organic farmers are <B>supposed to</B> not use <i>synthetic</i> 'cides or fertilizers. Most "natural" 'cides and fertilizers are just as bad or even worse!<br>
Some studies have even found organic to have an identical amount of pesticides! Also, the amount of pesticides in your produce doesn't do anything noticable.<br>
